				<p>Hello and welcome! My name is C.S. Rhymes and I'm a full time web developer and a part time author (in my spare time).</p>
				<h2>Web Development</h2>
				<p>I specialise in PHP and JavaScript frontend development and have learnt on the job and from reading online articles and blogs. There are some great resources out there and if you encounter an issue, chances are someone else has encountered it too and posted thes olution online. </p>
				<p>One of the reasons I have made this site and the <a href="/blog/" title="blog">blog</a> is to post development information that I discovered that may be useful to others. </p>
				<p>Web Development moves at a fast pace and I enjoy learning new techniques and using new tools to help make my work more rewarding. </p>
				<h2>Books</h2>
				<p>Like a lot of people, I have always wanted to write a book, so I decided to become an author with the help of the self publication service available for Amazon Kindle. As a developer, I find the best way to learn about something new is to go out and try it. As well as writing, editing, then getting the book published, I then used it as a way of learning more about digital marketing to generate interest in the book. One result of that is this website.</p>

				<p>I enjoyed writing and publishing the first book so much that I have now written a second book. Details of my books are available on the <a href="/books/" title="Books">books</a> page. </p>
