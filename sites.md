## Orkos House, Naxos

The owner of this site wanted a more modern and clean site. They also wanted a site that would work well on mobile devices. Therefore I decided to use the Foundation framework to help make a clean and modern site that is also responsive.

## The Robin Hood, Buckingham

Here is one I worked on a few years ago now. A local pub wanted a site they could easily manage and update themselves so I helped them install and set up a wordpress site, with a bit of customisation on the wordpress template.
