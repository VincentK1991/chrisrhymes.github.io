description: "Help me raise money for charity by giving up coffee for December! Use the hash tag #decafcember"
---

I'm a web developer and I drink a lot of coffee. Too much coffee. I've decided to give up coffee for December and help raise some money for charity at the same time. 

<div style="text-align: center;"><i class="fa fa-coffee fa-4x" ></i></div>

So why am I raising money and for who?

## British Red Cross

Recently we were in need of a loan wheelchair for a few weeks so my daughter could get around her school a bit easier. I called up the local doctors and the hospital but they were unable to help. Instead, they pointed me to the [British Red Cross](http://www.redcross.org.uk/) who offer a wheel chair loan service for a simple donation. With a quick phone call we had arranged to pick up the wheel chair from a near by town. 

I had heard of the British Red Cross before but had never realised the amount of work they do, both in the UK and world wide. I wanted to give up one of my luxuries to help others, especially at Christmas time.

## Help me raise money

So how can you help? 

Help sponsor me to give up coffee for December. A suggested amount is a pound a day for the 31 days of December, but any donation is welcome. 

Another idea is to put aside the same amount of money you spend on buying coffee for the month of December. If you buy 2 cups of coffee a week for £2 each, then why not put aside £4 a week for a donation.
