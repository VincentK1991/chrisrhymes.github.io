		<p>I have written a couple of books that are available to buy on Amazon. </p>

		<p>I was looking at the books on the Kindle Store and noticed that many of them had very similar titles, such as "10 ways to promote your site", or "Easy ways of getting to the top of search engines". This gave me the idea to write a book from a different angle, to stand out from the crowd, but also to help people avoid some of the common mistakes I have observed over my years of web development and browsing.</p>

		<p>I decided to write a book called "How NOT to make a website", to help you understand what to avoid when making a site to help improve your visitors experience.</p>

		<p>My book "How NOT to make a website" is available from the Amazon Kindle store. </p>

		<p>My second book was insired by my friends and family, asking very similar questions about smartphones and the differences between them. More importantly, I wanted to write a book about smartphones that was easy to understand, so even people who have never even picked up a smartphone, let alone used one, would be able to read it.</p>
		<p>The book starts off with the differences between the main smartphone operating systems and then goes on to the common touch screen controls and the main functions, such as contacts and messaging. </p>
